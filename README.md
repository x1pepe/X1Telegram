X1Telegram - by X1pepe 2022.

- What is? 
- Well, just a piece of code based on Alex Gyver's FastBot libraries, which is flashed in an Esp8266/Esp32 Arduino module.

What it makes? 
- Through a personalized Telegram BOT you can:
- . Receive and send Telegram messages.
- . Download files to your local IP passed to the chat.
- . Activate a led/relay from Telegram to the Msx to connect things remotely.
- . Online updates.
- . Chat and send streaming video (only with Esp32Cam).

- In other words, it is an Arduino Telegram client for Msx... and also in every vintage computer throught serial port.

What I need? 
- A msx!
- (or any other computer) with cartridge or serial port / Rs232, an Arduino WiFi Esp8266/Esp32 module and X1Telegram flashed in it.
- The ID of the Telegram chat to which you want to connect your Msx and a BOT created in Telegram with BotFather.
